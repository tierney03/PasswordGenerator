# PasswordGenerator

This password generator was created by using the starter code of HTML, CSS and a few pieces of Javascript. It is set up to ask prompts for what one would like included in the random password and then produce one with that set of criteria.

I kept with the look and style provided to me and focused on the Javascript.
